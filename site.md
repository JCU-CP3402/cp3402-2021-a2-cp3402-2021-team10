Our website is about a group called "Autism Support Group", which is located in Australia
 
Our website contains five interfaces and a registration interface. The home page contains some information about the symptoms of autistic patients and the data results obtained after the investigation. The Services Provided interface contains a wide range of media and illustrations. The Suggested Projects interface covers information about ENVIRONMENT, LOCAL COMMUNITY, FUNDRAISING and many illustrations. These illustrations allow people to read the information more intuitively.

In addition, many additional resources can also be obtained through WPFORMS. To add images, just upload them to the built-in WordPress media library.
